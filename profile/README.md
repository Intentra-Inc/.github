**Trust and Liability Infrastructure for Agent-Initiated Commerce**

---

## About

Intentra builds open systems that allow merchants, platforms, and payment networks
to prove consent, intent, and authorization when AI agents transact on behalf of users.

The payment rails exist. The agent protocols exist. 
The evidence layer does not. We're building it.

## Our Projects

### [Agentic-Commerce-Liability-System](https://github.com/intentra/agentic-commerce-liability-system)
**Agentic Commerce Liability System** — Open source evidence infrastructure for AI agent transactions.

- 6-entity evidence chain (Principal → Agent → Delegation → Intent → Authorization → Evidence Bundle)
- Protocol agnostic (UCP, AP2, ACP, TAP, x402, KYA, etc.)
- Cryptographically secure (SHA-256 hash chains, Ed25519 signatures)
- Dispute-ready evidence exports
- Infrastructure that integrates with existing payment rails and identity systems

## Why We Exist

When a human makes a purchase, liability is clear. The human clicked "Buy." If disputed, chargeback rules apply.

When an AI agent makes a purchase on behalf of a human, liability is unclear:

- **The human says:** "I didn't authorize that"
- **The agent platform says:** "Our agent followed instructions"
- **The merchant says:** "We received a valid payment request"
- **The payment processor says:** "We processed what we were told"

**Everyone points fingers. No one has proof.**

Intentra exists to make agent-initiated commerce auditable, defensible, and scalable.

There is no neutral, verifiable, tamper-proof evidence of:
- What authority the human actually granted
- What constraints existed on that authority
- What the agent intended to do
- What the agent actually did
- Who approved it along the way

Without this evidence layer:
- Chargebacks will explode
- Fraud will scale (agents as deniability shields)
- Merchants will refuse agent transactions
- Regulators will intervene
- Lawsuits will have no evidence to resolve them

**Intentra provides the missing evidence layer.**

## Our Principles

**Open Source First**
We believe trust infrastructure should be inspectable. Open source is the only way.

**Protocol Agnostic**
We don't pick winners. ACLS works with Visa TAP, Google AP2, Stripe/OpenAI ACP, Coinbase x402, and any protocol.

**Neutral Infrastructure**
Intentra is Switzerland. We serve the entire ecosystem—agent platforms, merchants, payment processors—without favoritism.

Projects are published incrementally and marked clearly as experimental or production-ready.
